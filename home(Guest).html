        <div class="packing">
            <h2>PACKING TIPS</h2>
            <p><b>1. Make a Packing List:</b> Create a comprehensive list of items you'll
            need for your trip. This will help you avoid forgetting important things 
            and prevent over-packing.</p>
    
            <p><b>2. Check the Weather:</b> Research the weather conditions at your destination
                during your travel dates. Pack clothes that are appropriate for the 
                forecasted weather.
            </p>
    
            <p><b>3. Choose Versatile Clothing:</b> Pack clothing items that can be mixed and 
                matched easily. Stick to a color scheme that works well together, so you can 
                create multiple outfits with fewer pieces.</p>
            <p><b>4. Roll Clothes:</b> Rolling clothes instead of folding them can save space and
                 reduce wrinkles. It's especially effective for casual wear like t-shirts, jeans, 
                 and lightweight tops.</p>
            <p><b>5. Use Packing Cubes:</b> Packing cubes can help you organize your belongings, 
                separate different types of items, and compress your clothes to maximize space.</p>
            <p><b>6. Limit Shoes:</b> Shoes can be bulky and heavy. Try to limit yourself to a few 
                pairs of versatile shoes that can be worn with different outfits.</p>
            <p><b>7. Toiletries and Cosmetics:</b> Use travel-sized toiletries or invest in refillable
                 travel containers. Place liquids in sealable plastic bags to prevent leaks. Bring 
                 only essential cosmetics.</p>
            <p><b>8. Tech and Entertainment:</b> Pack chargers, power banks, and any necessary tech 
                devices. Download e-books, movies, or music in advance for entertainment during travel.</p>
            <p><b>9. Medications and Essentials:</b> Pack any necessary medications, prescriptions, and a 
                small first aid kit. Don't forget essentials like your passport, travel documents, and wallet.</p>
            <p><b>10. Travel Towel:</b> Consider packing a quick-drying travel towel. They take up less space 
                and can be useful if your accommodation doesn't provide towels or for beach trips.</p>
            <p><b>11. Check Baggage Allowances:</b> Be aware of your airline's baggage allowances to avoid extra fees.
                 Weigh your luggage before heading to the airport.</p>
            <p><b>12. Layering for Cold Weather:</b> If you're traveling to a colder destination, focus on layering. 
                It's more efficient than packing bulky sweaters and coats.</p>
            <p><b>13. Laundry Options:</b> Research if there are laundry facilities at your accommodation or nearby. 
                This can help you pack fewer clothes and do laundry during your trip.</p>
            <p><b>14. Pack Important Documents:</b> Keep copies of your passport, identification, travel insurance, and 
                itinerary in both physical and digital formats.</p>
            <p><b>15. Secure Valuables:</b> Use a money belt, hidden pouch, or secure pockets to keep your valuables like 
                money, credit cards, and passport safe.
            <p><b>16. Travel Adapters:</b> If traveling internationally, pack the appropriate travel adapters to charge your 
                devices.</p>  
            <p><b>17. Consider the Activities:</b> Pack items that are specific to the activities you plan to do, whether it's 
                hiking gear, swimwear, or formal attire for special events.</p>
            <p><b>18. Leave Space for Souvenirs:</b> If you plan to shop during your trip, leave some space in your luggage for 
                souvenirs and gifts.</p>
            <p><b>19. Minimize Just-in-Case Items:</b> Avoid packing items for hypothetical situations. Stick to the essentials 
                to keep your luggage lightweight.</p>
            <p><b>20. Double-Check Before Leaving:</b> Before you leave home, double-check your packing list to make sure you haven't 
                forgotten anything important.</p>
